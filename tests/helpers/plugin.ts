/**
 * The one test seam for the Plugin Server: the real `mcp.ts`, run by the
 * running Node with no shell, as the Host runs it (FirstMate ADR-0028), against
 * a temporary Plugin directory, spoken to exactly as the Host speaks to it.
 *
 * Nothing here imports a module of the Plugin. What a test may see is what the
 * Host may see: the JSON-RPC lines on stdout, the diagnostics on stderr, the
 * exit code, and the files the Plugin writes into its own directory. That is
 * what lets the whole inside of this Plugin be rewritten without touching a
 * test.
 *
 * The Host starts a Plugin Server in the Plugin's own directory, so a test
 * gives it a temporary one. The code still comes from this repository; only
 * the directory the Plugin keeps `worklog.db` in is temporary.
