# Worklog

A FirstMate Plugin that keeps what you work on from one Meeting to the next,
and the free Notes that belong to no Meeting.

Read [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) for the words this project uses — Entry, Note,
Status, Meeting, Cycle — and [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr) for why a Cycle starts
when Scheduler says so and why the data is in SQLite.

## Install it

One command, from its git URL. The files land in FirstMate's Shelf, the Plugin
is registered in the same step, and nothing it ships is run:

```sh
firstmate install https://github.com/luanAfons0/worklog.git worklog
systemctl --user restart firstmate
```

Then open the Index Page, find `worklog`, and open its Plugin Page.

To let Scheduler start a Cycle at every Meeting, record a Grant from Scheduler
to Worklog and restart again. A Grant is one way and covers one pair:

```sh
firstmate grant scheduler worklog
systemctl --user restart firstmate
```

Developing it instead? Register the directory where it already lives:

```sh
node src/cli.ts add worklog /absolute/path/to/worklog   # in FirstMate
```

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the rest.

The Plugin Page has three tabs: **Cycle**, **Earlier Cycles** and **Notes**.
The keys 1, 2 and 3 choose one, and N starts a new Entry.
Drag an Entry to another column to give it that Status, or up and down to set
its place in the column; the Meeting lists each section in that order. In a Note, Shift+Enter
saves it.

Edit an Entry or a Note and its text stays formatted, as in Notion. Click a
block to type in it: that block alone shows its Markdown, and it is formatted
again the moment you leave it. Enter in a list starts the next item; Enter on
an empty item or an empty line starts a new block. Tab and Shift+Tab indent a
list item. Up and Down at the edge of a block go to the next one. Click a
checkbox to tick it. Ctrl+click opens a link. The first Esc leaves the block,
and the second closes the dialog.

It needs Node 24 or newer, for TypeScript with no build step and for
`node:sqlite`. The Host starts `mcp.ts` with its own Node, on Windows and on
Linux alike, so the Plugin needs no Node of its own there. `mcp` is the `sh`
wrapper for a `wsl` Place, where the Host starts `./mcp`. The Host's service
`PATH` often has only an older Node, so `mcp` looks for one in this order:
`WORKLOG_NODE`, `node` on `PATH`, then every Node under nvm. With none, it says
so in one sentence and the Plugin is Stopped.

## What it keeps

- An **Entry** is one thing you work on: a title, an optional Markdown body,
  a Status — `Todo`, `In Progress`, `In Review` or `Done` — and an optional
  **Link**: the http or https address of the issue or pull request it is
  about, in Linear, GitHub or elsewhere. The Entry card shows it as a small
  mark in its top-right corner (Linear's, GitHub's, or a plain link) that
  opens it in a new tab.
- A **Cycle** is the time from one Meeting to the next, named by the moment it
  started. A new Entry goes into the current Cycle. The first Cycle starts by
  itself the first time Worklog needs one.
- When a Cycle starts, every Entry that is not `Done` moves into it with its
  Status unchanged. It is the same Entry, not a copy. `Done`
  Entries stay in the Cycle they were done in.
- An Entry that is not `Done` is always in the current Cycle. Set a `Done`
  Entry in an earlier Cycle back to any other Status, and it moves into the
  current Cycle in the same write.
- Every Cycle is kept. The Page lists the earlier ones, newest first, each
  named by the moment it started; open one to see what was Done in it.
- A **Note** is free Markdown text. It has no Status and belongs to no Cycle,
  so it never moves. Notes are listed newest first.

Everything lives in one file, `worklog.db`, in the Plugin directory. Git ignores
it. Worklog starts empty. A Plugin directory from before the rename to Worklog
holds `daily.db` instead; the first start renames it to `worklog.db`, with every
Cycle, Entry and Note in it.

## The Popup form

`web/new.html` is a small second page: choose Entry or Note, type, press
Enter. An Entry has a title, a body, an optional Link and a Status that starts
at `Todo`; a Note has only a body. Shift+Enter is a new line in the body. After a save the page
goes to the main Plugin Page, `./`.

It is the page a FirstMate Shortcut opens in a Popup. Going to `./` leaves
the Popup's address, so the Popup hides by itself. In a normal browser, at
`/p/worklog/new.html`, it lands on the main page instead. Once the Shortcut work
lands in FirstMate, bind it with:

```sh
node src/cli.ts bind <keys> worklog new.html   # in FirstMate
```

## Tools

Every tool answers its data twice: as JSON text, and as `structuredContent`.
A tool given bad input answers a JSON-RPC error with one sentence.

| Tool           | Arguments                                   | Answers                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `start_cycle`  | none                                        | one sentence, and `{ cycle, moved, said }` |
| `get_cycle`    | optional `id`                               | that Cycle, or the current one, and its Entries |
| `list_cycles`  | none                                        | `{ cycles }`, newest first, each with counts by Status |
| `create_entry` | `title`, `status`, optional `body`, `link`  | the new Entry                    |
| `update_entry` | `id`, and any of `title`, `body`, `status`, `link` | the Entry as it now is    |
| `move_entry`   | `id`, and `status`, `before` (optional)     | the Entry in its new place       |
| `delete_entry` | `id`                                        | the Entry that is gone           |
| `meeting_markdown` | none                                    | the Markdown, and `{ markdown, done, inReview, workingOn }` |
| `list_notes`   | none                                        | `{ notes }`, newest first        |
| `create_note`  | `body`, `title` (optional)                  | the new Note                     |
| `update_note`  | `id`, `body`, `title` (optional)            | the Note as it now is            |
| `delete_note`  | `id`                                        | the Note that is gone            |

`start_cycle` is the tool a Scheduler Job calls at every Meeting, under a
Grant from Scheduler to Worklog. Every call starts exactly one Cycle
(ADR-0001), and its text is one sentence, because a Scheduler Run keeps one:
`Started the Cycle of Tue 23 Sep 10:00 and moved 4 Entries into it.` The
moment is on the clock of the machine Worklog runs on. The Page's **Start a new
Cycle** button calls the same tool, after one question, for the day Scheduler
did not.

`meeting_markdown` decides what the Page's **Start presentation** shows: one
Entry at a time, full window, for the Statuses chosen at the top. It has a
"Done" section — the Entries Done in the Cycle before the current one, then
those already Done in the current one — an "In review" section, when
anything is `In Review` — and a "Working on" section — the current Cycle's
`In Progress` Entries, then its `Todo` ones, each in the order of its column. It lists titles only;
the title of an Entry with a Link is a Markdown link to it, `[title](link)`. Present after the Meeting's `start_cycle`
has run; before, "Done" also holds what was reported last time.

Every Entry a tool answers carries `link`: its address, or `null` when it has
none. A `link` is an absolute `http:` or `https:` address of at most 2048
characters, kept trimmed; any other is refused. On `update_entry`, a `link` of
`null` or `""` takes the Link away.

Any Status may go to any other. A `body` of `null` or `""` takes the body
away. Bodies are Markdown; the Page shows them formatted with `web/markdown.js`,
a small renderer written for this Plugin, so the Page loads nothing from a CDN.

## Running it

`mcp.ts` is the Plugin Server, as the Host runs it with its own Node: MCP over
stdio. `./mcp` is the same, for a `wsl` Place. `npm test`
runs every test; `npm run typecheck` checks the types.
